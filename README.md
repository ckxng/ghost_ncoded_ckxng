=====================

**NOTE: There are some statically added adjustments, such as the navigation links at the bottom that might not make this theme well suited for other blogs.  You'd probably be better off just using the original theme!**

A GitHub homage theme for the [Ghost Blogging platform](http://ghost.org "Ghost Blogging Platform") - forked from Casper, the default Ghost theme.
