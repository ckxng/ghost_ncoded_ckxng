N-Coded fork by Ckxng
=====================

**NOTE: There are some statically added adjustments, such as the navigation links at the bottom that might not make this theme well suited for other blogs.  You'd probably be better off just using the original theme!**

A GitHub homage theme for the [Ghost Blogging platform](http://ghost.org "Ghost Blogging Platform") - forked from Casper, the default Ghost theme.

Visit Ghost at: [www.ghost.org](http://www.ghost.org "Ghost")

Status
======

This theme is in-use at http://www.ckxng.com and contains hard-coded links that make it appropriate for use only on that domain.
